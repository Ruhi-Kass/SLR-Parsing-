# SLR(1) Visual Parser

A beautiful, interactive web-based tool for visualizing the entire SLR(1) parsing process — from grammar definition to parse tree construction.

Perfect for students, educators, and anyone learning or teaching compiler design and parsing techniques.


## Features

- **Step-by-step visualization** of the SLR(1) parsing pipeline:
  1. Grammar Definition
  2. Augmented Grammar
  3. FIRST & FOLLOW Sets
  4. LR(0) Item Sets (States)
  5. DFA Diagram (Data Flow Diagram of states with transitions)
  6. SLR(1) Parsing Table
  7. Stack-based Parsing Simulation
  8. Visual Parse Tree

- **Interactive DFA Diagram** with properly connected arrows and clean layout
- **Real-time stack visualization** during parsing
- **Rich parse tree rendering** with textbook-style node connections
- **Grammar presets** for quick testing (including nullable, recursive, and expression grammars)
- **Clean, modern UI** built with React and Tailwind CSS
- **Conflict detection** with helpful error messages

## How to Use

1. Enter your context-free grammar in the left editor using standard notation:
   - `->` or `→` for production arrow
   - `|` for alternatives
   - `ε` or `epsilon` for empty string

2. (Optional) Enter an input string to parse in the simulation step.

3. Click **Compile** or select a preset to analyze the grammar.

4. Navigate through the 8 steps using the sidebar or "Next" button.

5. In the final step, step through the parsing simulation and watch the stack and parse tree update in real time.

## Example Grammar

```
E -> E + T | T
T -> T * F | F
F -> ( E ) | id
```

Input: `id * ( id + id )`
